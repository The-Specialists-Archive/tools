/*QUAKED func_button (0 .5 .8) ? TOUCH
Func_button:  A button is just what it says, but it can also be used as a pressure plate type device. It moves in a direction, triggers something, waits a predetermined time, then moves back to its original position. Ordinary buttons that are to be pushed should have a trigger_playerpushbutton targeting them so that Corvus will use the animation to push them, rather than just bumping into them like a bumbling space-marine.
Flags:
	Touch:	Supposedly allows the button to be fired without the trigger_playerpushbutton, as for example a floor button. But actually I find it's not needed, & doesn't seem to do anything. If a button has no targetname-value, it will push when the player bumps into it, just like in Quake.
Keys:
	Angle:	The direction you want the button to move.
	Target:	You must target another entity for this to have any real function to it.
	Targetname:	Has same value as target-field of the trigger_playerpushbutton that tells Corvus to use the button-push animation.
	Speed:	The speed at which the button will move to its destination. Default is 40.
	Wait:	The amount of time the button waits before returning to its original position. Default is 1. A wait of -1 will cause the button to never return.
	Lip:	A button moves a default distance of the width of the brush minus the lip. A negative lip will cause the button to move farther than its width. The default lip is 4.
	Health:	Use health for shootable buttons. Once its health reaches 0, it triggers. This seems able to work together with targetting by a trigger_playerpushbutton, but I can't think of a good reason to do this.
	Sounds:	The sound to play as it moves. Default is 0.
		0) Silent
		1) Basic Button
		2) Clanky Button
		3) Steam Button
	Message:	Displays a text string when the button is fully in. The value is the line-number of the message in the levelmsg file in htic2-1.pak. For a custom message, it is usually best to use the text_msg key instead.
	Text_msg:	Value is the text displayed when the button is fully pushed in. Doesn't seem to be able to play an audio file.

	Crusher:	A door without this flag will stop when it hits another entity. With this flag set, it will keep moving towards its destination, causing damage to it and eventually destroying it.
	No Monster:	Monsters cannot use this door.

	Toggle:	When this flag is set, the door will wait in its start and end position until it's triggered again.
	Animated_fast:	Don't know. An animated texture works, but animates faster.
Keys:
	Message:	Put a text message on the door. For example, when the player walks up to a door that hasn't been triggered, the door can print the message, This door is locked. Messages are set by a number corresponding to a line in levelmsg.txt, as listed here (45, "I'll have to open this elsewhere", is probably the most useful value). text_msg does not seem to work for func_door.

	Speed:	The speed the door moves to its destination. Default is 100.
	Wait:	Amount of time the door waits in its destination position. Default is 3. If wait is set to -1, the door will not return. If the wait is set to -2, once triggered, it will constantly cycle from its start to its destination position.
	Lip:	A door moves a default distance of the width of the brush minus the lip. A negative lip will cause it to move farther than its width. The default lip is 8.
	Dmg:	The amount of damage the door does if it hits another entity. The default is 2.
	Team:	If you have two touching doors that you want to open at the same time, make both doors have the team key value.

Func_door_rotating:  A rotating door is an entity that must have an origin brush associated with it to work. It can rotate on any of the axis, and can be used for objects other than doors. In Heretic II, you will see constantly moving gears that are rotating doors.
Flags:
	Start Open:	Starts in its final position. Sometimes it's easier to build a door where you want it to end.
	Reverse:	When you give a door a distance (angle) to rotate, reverse will make it go that many degrees in the opposite direction.

/*QUAKED func_train (0 .5 .8) ? START_ON TOGGLE BLOCK_STOPS HASORIGIN NO_CLIP PUSHPULL
Func_train:  Trains are entities that move on a path predetermined by the designer. Used in conjunction with path corners, this is one of the most powerful entities in the game. It can be used as a platform that carries the player on a non-linear course, it can be used for objects that look to be falling, or it can be used for objects that look to be sliding across a surface. Trains can carry models also. Rotating trains must have an origin brush.
Flags:
	Start On:	The train is active at the start of the level.
	Toggle:	Waits at each path corner to be triggered again.
	Block_Stop:	If the train runs into another entity, it will stop.
	Has Origin:	Uses the origin brush rather than the lower left corner of the train.
	No_clip:	The train is no_clip. Used for moving cameras. (see misc_remote_camera for details.)
	PushPull:	With this flag selected, an object becomes pushable by Corvus. If you stand Corvus in front of it and hit his action key, he should go into a slight crouch. He can then push it, or pull it. This is no longer used.

	Damage:	The amount of damage the train does to another entity. Default is 2.

	Rotate:	The speed that the train should rotate at. The actual rotation of the train is based on the path corners.
	Wait:	The amount of time to wait at each path corner. A wait of -1 will cause the train to wait at a path corner until it is triggered again. A wait of -3 will cause the train to explode, and should be only put on one path corner. A wait of -4 will cause a model attached to go through its frames of animation. Use in conjunction with count.
	Count:	Number of frames in a model.
	File:	The name of the file if you want to move a model. An example is models/objects/broom/tris.fm.
	Materialtype:	What rubble to use if it explodes. Look at the breakable brush rubble.

Func_timer:  A timer is used if you want an object to trigger at either a regular interval or a random interval. This is cool for broken objects as it gives them a sporadic feel. Timer's can not be touched.
Flags:
	Start On:	The timer is immediately active, and doesn't need to be triggered.
Keys:
	Wait:	The amount of time between triggering. Default is 1.
	Random:	Used in conjunction with wait, the amount of time will vary. Default is 0. The range of time becomes wait+random to wait-random.

/*QUAKED func_areaportal (0 0 0) ?
Func_areaportal:  An areaportal is an entity that actually doesn't draw anything beyond it. If you are building a level with doors, this is an incredibly useful tool for cutting down poly counts. It is also very tricky to set up. Basically you build a door, build an areaportal inside the door but as wide and tall (or a bit more) and target the door to the areaportal. When the door opens, the areaportal disappears, and when the door closes, it reappears. The tricky part comes in having it actually work. Areaportals have to separate two distinct regions, and there can be no other openings between those two regions. There are many tutorials on the net for making areaportals work, but just remember that the regions have to be separate and distinct.

	Angles:	Used to make the train rotate when it hits the path corner. The train must have an origin brush as part of it. Angles are cumulative, so if the first path corner has 0 40 0 and the second one has 0 50 0, then it will have rotated 90 degrees on the y-axis.
