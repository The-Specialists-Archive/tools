Recommended number of bots/players: 3 bots for single player

IMPORTANT: METAMOD-P is REQUIRED to run RCbot on this map (sc4.8/4.7...). I recommend metamod-p v1.21p37 for sc4.7/4.8 & newer. (included in w00tguy123-bot-pack 4_8.rar)

For older (4.x) Svencoop versions you need one of these rcbot dll's and metamod-p 
(metamod-p v1.21p37 recommended & included in w00tguy's sc4.8 rcbot installer)

Details/Notes/problems
-----------------------

I included a weapons.ini to be used with this map, the uzi range is set to low with my other weapons.ini's, for this map. Or the default weapons.ini that comes with the rcbot installer will work well too. With the default ini bots will use the sniper rifle much more than uzi's, even at close range. With the included ini bots will use uzi's more.

I have only tried this map on sc4.8, I don't know if it will work with any older versions, try at your own risk. sc4.7 may work with this map? sc4.8 bots will chase after dropped weapons, I think I got all those places waypointed so they won't get lost...

* Bots can run the whole map but won't do everything... 

* Bots will only raise 1 of 4 flags (the 2nd flag on top of building). A bot may get stuck to 2nd flag, you may need to go get him after capturing the 3rd flag (mortar flag), use your crowbar to make noise and he will let go of flag and follow.

* Bots won't use the mortar to open the castle wall, a player must do this.

* Bots won't climb the castle wall deployable ladders, but will lower them, sometimes.

* Bots will use the castle gate to enter, but won't press the lever to open it.

* Bots will blow up both castle towers.

* You may have to go hunt the king, if he gets to far from the castle. Bots will respawn at start spawn and mortar spawn, after the castle is conquered and the king appears.

Have fun,
