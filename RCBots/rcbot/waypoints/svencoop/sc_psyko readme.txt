Map Author: Lemonsoda

Map is included with sc4.8 & sc4.7/4.6/4.5 (not tested on 4.6/4.5, but may work ok?)

Recommended number of bots/players: 2 to 3 (2 bots, for single player)

IMPORTANT: METAMOD-P is REQUIRED to run RCbot on this map (sc4.8/4.7...). the standard metamod may not work properly, certain events may not occur, which may prevent you from triggering the map end/change or may cause a crash. I recommend metamod-p v1.21p37 for sc4.7/4.8 & newer (metamod-p v1.19p32 may work ok too). Most all newer maps for svencoop (4.0,4.5,4.6...) require metamod-p over the standard metamod, for plugins such as RCbot. (included in w00tguy123-bot-pack 4_8.rar)

Details/Notes/problems
-----------------------

A new waypoint, bots can go to all areas, but cannot do everything. Bots can do some (or parts of) puzzles but a player is needed to complete most puzzles. Forming a squad with a bot can be helpful with some areas, but not required... All puzzles can be completed single player, and bots help with enemies, especially with the final area battle...

See the RCbot Svencoop Waypoints forum for sc_psyko topic with detailed info & tips...
