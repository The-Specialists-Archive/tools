      <h3 align="left">Extracting Files</h3>
      <p align="left">You must first extract the RCBot files from the zip file 
        into the Half-life folder. To do this you need winzip (http://www.winzip.com) 
        or if you are using windows XP you can use the integrated zip file extraction.</p>
      <p align="left">You need to extract the zip file to the <strong>half-life</strong> 
        folder (or more precisely, the same folder where the MOD folder also resides 
        in)</p>
      <p align="left">Example:</p>
    </div>
    <blockquote>
      <div align="left">
        <p>If half-life is installed to C:\Sierra\Half-life then extract it to 
          C:\Sierra\Half-life</p>
      </div>
      <div align="left">
        <p>If you are using Steam, then extract to C:\Program Files\Steam\SteamApps\&lt;email&gt;\half-life</p>
      </div>
      <div align="left">
        <p>If you want to install the bot to Deathmatch Classic or other Steam 
          Provided MOD see the <a href="faq.htm">FAQ</a></p>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <div align="left">
      <p align="left">Now that the files are extracted we need to set-up the MOD 
        to read the rcbot files.</p>

      <h3 align="left"> What is the Standalone DLL for?</h3>
      <p align="left">The standalone DLL is used if you do not want to use Metamod 
        (see metamod below to see what metamod is all about).</p>
      <h2 align="left">How to Install</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <div align="left">
          <p>Each MOD comes with a file called &quot;liblist.gam&quot; in it's 
            folder. This file tells Half-life about the MOD and what DLL files 
            it uses. We are only interested in what DLL files the MOD will use 
            to install.</p>
        </div>
      </blockquote>
      <ol>
        <li> 
          <div align="left">Open the desired liblist.gam file in <strong>notepad</strong> 
            or a simple text editing program</div>
        </li>
        <li>Scroll down to where a line says either...<br>
          <br>
          &quot;<strong>gamedll</strong>&quot; OR &quot;<strong>gamedll_linux</strong>&quot;</li>
        <li>If you are using Windows then we are only interested in the <strong>gamedll</strong>

        <li>If you are using Linux then we are only interest in the <strong>gamedll_linux</strong> 
          line </li>
        <li>First comment out the current line by adding two slashes, i.e. &quot;//&quot; 
          in fron t of the line, meaning Half-life will not read this line anymore 
          and you can still read it incase you want to change the old line back.</li>
        <li>Add a new line with the same &quot;gamedll&quot; as you want i.e. 
          either gamedll or gamedll_linux (windows or linux)</li>
        <li>On the right of the gamedll text seperated by a space is the DLL file 
          we want.</li>
        <li>If you are using Windows, change this to &quot;..\rcbot\dlls\rcbot.dll&quot;</li>
        <li>If you are using Linux, change this to &quot;../rcbot/dlls/rcbot_i486.so&quot;</li>

    <div align="left"> 
      <h3 align="left">What is the Metamod DLL for?</h3>
      <p align="left">The Metamod DLL is for metamod to read the DLL file so it 
        can run as a plugin.</p>
      <h3 align="left">What is Metamod?</h3>
      <p align="left">Metamod is just another DLL file which when hooked up to 
        the Half-life MOD can run many plugins (or DLL files) at once. For example 
        you can easily allow two different bots to run (e.g. RCbot and Whichbot) 
        at the same time.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Installing to Metamod</h3>
      <p align="left">Before you start make sure you have metamod &quot;installed&quot;. 
        All you need is to have a folder called &quot;addons&quot; in your MOD 
        directory and a folder in there called &quot;Metamod&quot;. In the Metamod 
        folder, it should have a file called &quot;plugins.ini&quot; and another 
        folder called &quot;dlls&quot; which stores the Metamod DLL file. We do 
        not need to worry about the metamod DLL file or it's location unless you 
        have not installed metamod properly.</p>
      <p align="left">You must have metamod installed first. If you do not have 
        it you need to download the latest Metamod from <a href="http://www.metamod.org">http://www.metamod.org</a>

    <div align="left"> 
      <p align="left">Now, Metamod has a file called &quot;plugins.ini&quot; in

        (or SO files for linux) of the plugins it wants to use, and the operating 
        system required for each file.</p>
